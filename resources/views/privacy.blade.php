    </p>
    <h1>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h1>

        implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
        other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.&nbsp; If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
        revised version of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
